# Speedcubing Assistant

The goal of this project is to implement a variety of algorithms (and AI) that can be helpful for a human attempting to improve at speedcubing.


### Completed
1. Working cube and scrambler
2. A convenient means of iterating through the different possible moves for search

### Working On
1. 2D and 3D visualization (orientations are annoying)
2. Simple Search Algorithms and Commutators
